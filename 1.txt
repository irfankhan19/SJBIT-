Apache™ Subversion®

"Enterprise-class centralized version control for the masses"

Welcome to subversion.apache.org, the online home of the Apache Subversion™ software project. Subversion is an open source version control system. Founded in 2000 by CollabNet, Inc., the Subversion project and software have seen incredible success over the past decade. Subversion has enjoyed and continues to enjoy widespread adoption in both the open source arena and the corporate world.

Subversion is developed as a project of the Apache Software Foundation, and as such is part of a rich community of developers and users. We're always in need of individuals with a wide range of skills, and we invite you to participate in the development of Apache Subversion. Here's how to get started.
